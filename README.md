**This repository contains the parts list and files required to build the tattoo machine I showcased in my [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EZwlKi-5l4).**

## Parts

I sourced the parts from Aliexpress, the BOM is of 30 USD. These parts can easily be replaced with cheaper parts, or sourced from elsewhere.

- [Male jack 6.35mm connector](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/4000152048894.html)
- [Power cord](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/33022847715.html)
- [GX16 male & female connectors](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005002050583778.html)
- [Motor attachment](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003481801077.html)

You'll need a basic soldering kit, and some wire. You'll also need a threaded insert if you want to secure the handle with the body. Oh, you'll of course need disposable tattoo tubes, the ones I use have an outer diameter of 8,00 mm. If yours are different, you'll need to modify the part "handle adapter". It's a very simple part, the free non-commercial version of F360 is what I used to design the machine.
As seen in the video, using a rubber band to prevent the needle from vibrating is highly recommended. 
Finally, the motor runs best on 7v, according to my experience. You can adjust the voltage depending on the particular skin type / body part / vegetable / effect you're working on. I wouldn't go higher than 10v, unless you want to tattoo bones.

## Building

I recommend printing the main body with PETG, black color for best effect. 50% infill, 0.2mm layer height.
The [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EZwlKi-5l4) is the best tutorial available. The assembly process takes less than 30 minutes. I advise you to wrap the motor with a fine layer of kapton or electrical tape, in order to secure it. Feel free to contribute with a better way of securing the motor. Maybe with tiny threaded inserts and tiny screws around the motor?

## Disclaimer

I do **not** recommend using this machine to tattoo a human being, or any living thing. It can be done, but you must know what you're doing. This machine can deliver very-good, profesionnal results if used by a profesionnal tattoo-artist.
